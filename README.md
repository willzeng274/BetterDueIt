## üß† Inspiration:

Productivity among the youth in this generation is decreasing rapidly due to the rise in addictive technology that do not give any benefits. For example, while social media platforms can provide useful insights, they are generally not used for learning and productivity. We concluded that there needs to be immediate action conducted to mitigate the damage done by the modern technology, designing an "mission" management system with monetary pressure to ensure their completion.

## üíª What it does:

BetterDueIt is a productivity app that encourages users to achieve their goals through the use of blockchain technology. With our mobile app, users can deposit a small fee as a sense of motivation and in completing their missions -- they will receive their deposit back upon completing the task. Users can also pay monthly subscriptions to purchase our blockchain currency for cosmetics, and a potential additional "annoy" feature to motivate their friends. The primary focus of the app is to set and accomplish tasks, where users set their tasks, a due date, and a deposit. On the home screen, the users tasks are shown, as well as a progression bar and a daily streak to promote the users to consistently use our app. Finally, we have a leaderboard system integrated, so that everyone is encouraging each other to complete their tasks through competition.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How we built it:

We built our application using React-Native with Expo, Xcode iPhone simulators, Typescript, Node, and a MongoDB Atlas database bootstrapped with Neurelo to store user login authentication as well as all of our users' missions for ease of access. Neurelo was also useful in setting up queries to search user data. The Avalanche blockchain network was also used as the primary currency to safely and rapidly deposit and withdraw money. 

## ü§î Challenges we ran into:

Even as a group of 4, it was all our first time working with blockchain. The understanding of the blockchain technology, such as smart contracts, ledgers, etc presented as a learning curve, where we spent the majority of time trying to implement a system to transfer tokens between wallets. 
Furthermore, it was also all our first time working with React Native. Although some of the group members had minimal experiences with React, it was still a huge learning curve for us. For some group members, it was their first hackathon. Adjustment to the overall hackathon atmosphere took a relatively long time and development were slowed down as a result.

## üî≠ What's next:

In the future, we hope to implement a social media aspect to our app where users can upload, view, and support other users  that are completing their missions. When other user‚Äôs support each other, they can be gifted tokens. There will also be a paid feature to send notifications to your friends to further push them into completing their goals. For example, a user may upload a video of them completing the task for other users to see. This can be extremely useful in cases like gym, DIY, cooking, etc, where they can either showcase their skills or receive feedback.
